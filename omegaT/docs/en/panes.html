            <p>This is where you type and edit your translation. The Editor pane
                   displays the text of the partially translated document: the text already
                   translated is displayed in translation while the untranslated text is
                   displayed in the original language. The displayed text is split into
                   segments and you may scroll through the document and double-click on any
                   segment to open and edit it. In the above case, the segments already
                   translated are shown in yellow.
            </p>
            <p>One of the above segments is the current segment. It is the segment
                   that is displayed in two parts. The upper part is in the source language,
                   in bold characters with a green background color, the lower part is the
                   editing field, ended by a marker: the marker is <code class="literal">&lt;segment nnnn&gt;</code> where
                   nnnn is a number of the segment in the project. Use the upper part as a
                   reference and replace or modify the contents of the editing field with
                   your translation.
            </p>
            <p>Note: the segment marker displays <code class="literal">&lt;segment
                      nnnn&nbsp;+yy&nbsp;more&gt; when the segment is non-unique. In that case, yy is the
                      number of other occurrences of the segment in the
                      project.</code></p>
            <p>Depending upon the preferred editing behavior, the editing field for
                   the untranslated segment may be empty, contain the source text, or contain
                   the translation of the string most similar to the one to be translated.
                   When you move to another segment, the translation is validated and stored.
                   If you want the translation to be the same as the source, simply make the
                   editing field empty by removing all the text (select all with
                   <span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl+A</strong></span> and delete with <span class="keycap"><strong>Del</strong></span>). OmegaT is
                   able to store translations that are identical to the source. This is
                   useful for documents that contain trade marks, names or other proper
                   nouns, or parts in a third language that do not require translation. See
                   <span class="emphasis"><em>Translation editing</em></span> for more details.
            </p>
            <p>If you right click on the Editor pane, a pop-up menu opens,
                   offering<span class="bold"><strong> Cut, Copy, Paste</strong></span> (i.e. same
                   functions as <span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>X</strong></span>, <span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>C</strong></span> and <span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>V</strong></span>), <span class="bold"><strong>GoTo segment</strong></span> and
                   <span class="bold"><strong>Add glossary entry</strong></span> functions. In
                   addition, when the right click occurs on an opened segment, other options
                   concerning <span class="bold"><strong>Alternative translations</strong></span> are
                   proposed, for example to to jump to another instance of non-unique
                   segments.
            </p>
            <p>It is possible to drag text from anywhere in the main window and to
                   drop it within the segment. Texted dragged from outside the target segment
                   is copied, while text dragged from within the segment is moved.
            </p>
            <p>By default, it is not possible to select words in the source segment
                   using the keyboard rather than the mouse. Pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>F2</strong></span> key
                   allows to move the cursor into the source segment (or anywhere in the
                   editor) with the keyboard arrows. In this mode, "<span class="guilabel">Cursor lock
                      off</span>" is displayed at the bottom of the pane. To come back to
                   the standard mode "<span class="guilabel">Cursor lock on</span>", press
                   <span class="keycap"><strong>F2</strong></span> again.

            <p>The match viewer shows the most similar segments from translation
                   memories, both from internal project translation memory created in real
                   time as you translate your project and from ancillary translation memories
                   you have imported from your earlier jobs, or received from your client or
                   translation agency.
            </p>
            <p>When you move to the next segment, the first fuzzy match (the one
                   with the best matching percentage) is automatically selected. You may
                   select a different match by pressing <span class="guimenuitem">Ctrl+2, 3, 4, or
                      5</span>. Of course, pressing <span class="keycap"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>5</strong></span> will have no effect, if there is no match #5. To use the
                   selected match in your translation, use
                   <span class="guimenuitem">Ctrl+R</span> to replace the target field with the match or use
                   <span class="guimenuitem">Ctrl+I </span> to insert it at the cursor position.
            </p>
            <p>The matching percentage is roughly equivalent to taking the number
                   of common words in the matched and the matching segment and dividing by
                   the number of words in the longer of the two. The selected fuzzy match is
                   highlighted in bold, words that are missing in the segment you are
                   translating are colored blue and words adjacent to the missing parts
                   green. In the above example the source segment is <span class="bold"><strong>Context menu command</strong></span>. The top match is 100%,
                   because all words match. So do the next two matches, and the match #4 is
                   similar, but different. The line with the matching percentage also
                   includes the name of the translation memory containing the match. If there's no file name displayed,
                   the source is the internal project translation memory. Orphan
                   segments (the match #2) describe segments in the default project
                   translation memory that have no corresponding source segment.

            <p>A given source segment may require several different translations,
                   depending on the context. If the current translation of the segment does
                   not fit, the user can select <span class="guisubmenu">Edit → Create Alternative
                      Translation</span>. The target text entered after that will be
                   treated as an alternative translation of the source segment. You can

                   alternative translations are correct or to ask colleagues for their

                   below, the author of the PO file included a warning for the translator to
                   check the length of the translation:
